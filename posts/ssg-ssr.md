## What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

Reasons on why many developers choose React to program their apps.

- **React is very fast** Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick. responsive. quick and responsive.
- **React is modular** Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files. React’s modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript ’s maintainability problems.
- **React Native** Learning React comes with a bonus: React Native. React is not a ‘write once run anywhere library’, as the creators says, it’s a ‘learn once write anywhere’ library. Yes, you can write native apps for Android and iOS using React Native. Although you will not be able to use the exact same code you wrote for web, you will be able to use the same methodology and the same architecture.
- **Resuable Components** React provides a component based structure. Components are your block pieces. You start with tiny components like button, checkbox, dropdown etc. and the you create wrapper components composed of those smaller components. And then you write higher level wrapper components. And, it goes on like that until you have this one root component and that component is your app.
- **Easy to learn** Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React while Angular and Ember are referred to as ‘Domain-specific Language’, implying that it is difficult to learn them. To react, you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.
- **Simplicity** ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it. React uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript.
- **Native Approach** React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native). And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. So at the same time, we can make IOS, Android and Web applications.This is not a requirement; Developer can still write in plain JavaScript but JSX is much easier to use.

Hello there! First of all I want to introduce myself, my name is **Angel Vazquez**, creator of **@codenuggets** I’ve been working with for over 2 years, and I want to teach you everything I have learned so far in a simpler and educative way. If you are new to React, then this book is for you. No prior React knowledge is expected, We will start at the very beginning and move slowly. By the end, you will be ready to program in React with a real understanding of what you’re doing. I’m a person of action, I believe that one has to take actions and act upon his ideas as that’s the only way to really know the truth!

So let's get started!
