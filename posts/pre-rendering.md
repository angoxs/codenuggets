# The environment

We will choose and use the most powerful and modern tools to create our site. We will use **Next JS** as a starter template for our website, Then, we’ll work with **FlexBox**, **CSS Grid**, the most flexible way to implement your layout. We’ll learn to create fully customizable React components for buttons, the header, footer, navigation bar and more...

## What is Next Js?

- Next Js is a **JavaScript** framework created by **Vercel**. It lets you build server-side rendering and static web applications using React. It's a great tool to build your next website. It has many great features and advantages, which can make Nextjs your first option for building your next web application.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

## Why Next JS?

Next JS allows to create **production grade** React applications that scale. The world's leading companies use Next.js by Vercel to build static and dynamic websites and web applications.

### Terminal

We will be using the terminal to run our commands and install pretty much any library or system such as React or Git. To open the terminal press Command + Space and type terminal. It will direct you to the terminal.

```
Command + Space
Type Terminal
Hit Enter
```

## Home-Brew

Before anything else you will need home-brew. Which makes it much easier to install libraries on your Mac. This installation requires a Mac, In case you are using PC Follow [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install node.

## Installing Home-brew

To install node you will need to grab the command from home-brew and copy it in your Terminal. Click enter when you’re ready

## Install Node

```
brew install node
```

## Installing Next JS

To create a NEXT.JS app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

```
cd Documents/
```

### Then next type the following

```
npm init next-app nextjs-blog
```

💡Under the hood, this uses the tool called `create-next-app`, which bootstraps a NEXT JS app for you

Choose Default starter app

## Run the development server

You now have a directory called nextjs-blog . Let’s cd into it, in your terminal type the following.

```
cd nextjs-blog
```

Then run the following command

```
 npm run dev
```

This starts your NEXT JS app’s “development server”. Let’s check to see if it’s working. Open **localhost:3000** from your browser. If everything it’s working perfectly your site should be looking iike this.

Our site should look like this!

Go to localhost in your browser to preview your app

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Pretty awesome isn't it? Next we will install our code editor where will be learning React.

## Installing the code editor

We will need a code editor to work on our site. I highly recommend https://code.visualstudio.com

![Image of Yaktocat](https://cl.ly/8c485497aa7b/download/codeeditor.png)

One you have downloaded VScode, we will open it and open source code of our site that we just created

In explorer click Open Folder

```
Explore > Open Folder
```

```
Documents > Nextjs-blo > Open
```

## Conclusion

We’ve managed to get our development environment ready and functional. We can start designing our layout and slowly learn React.

Hooray! 🎉

If you did everything the proper way by now you should have your studio code setup next to your Nextjs app

Next step we'll be editing our code and learning what it all means!
